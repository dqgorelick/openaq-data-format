|averagingPeriod|Object|✓|Information about the time resolution of the measurement|`{"value": 1, "unit": "hours"}`|

### Formatted Data Object
The formatted data json object should look something like this:
```json
{"date":{"utc":"2020-10-01T00:00:00.000Z","local":"2020-10-01T04:00:00+04:00"},
  "parameter":"pm25","value":20,"unit":"µg/m³",
  "averagingPeriod":{"value":1,"unit":"hours"},
  "location":"US Diplomatic Post: Abu Dhabi","city":"Abu Dhabi","country":"AE",
  "coordinates":{"latitude":24.424399,"longitude":54.433746},
  "attribution":[{"name":"EPA AirNow DOS","url":"http://airnow.gov/index.cfm?action=airnow.global_summary"}],
  "sourceName":"StateAir_AbuDhabi","sourceType":"government","mobile":false}
```

### Dates and date ranges
Dates are stored as a javascript date containing both the local time and the UTC time.

```json
"date": {
  "utc": "2015-07-16T20:30:00.000Z",
  "local": "2015-07-17T03:30:00.000+07:00"
}
```

The averages are always backward looking. That means that if a source reports a time range (3 - 4pm), then the latest time is picked (4pm).

## Dealing with multiple measurements
It is possible that a station reports several measurements for the same pollutant per time period. When this occurs, the following measurement is stored:

- the one with the shortest averaging period (1 hour average instead of 24 hour rolling average)
- the one that reports the value in the pollutant's [preferred unit](https://github.com/openaq/openaq-data-format#preferred-units)

## Preferred Units
OpenAQ only accepts measurements in `µg/m³` and `ppm`. This means that volumetric concentrations reported in ppb are converted to ppm before being stored to the database. We do not convert between volumetric and mass concentrations (`µg/m³` <-> `ppm`) to avoid making assumptions.

The platform also has a preferred unit of measurement per pollutant, but this is not strictly enforced. The Dutch locations, for example, report all their values in µg/m3.

|Pollutant|Preferred unit|
|---|---|
|PM 2.5|µg/m³|
|PM 10|µg/m³|
|BC|µg/m³|
|CO|ppm|
|NO2|ppm|
|SO2|ppm|
|O3|ppm|

## Source types
Measurements can be provided by different types of sources:

- `government` - Sensors that are deployed by or on behalf of governmental bodies.
- `research` - Sensors that are deployed by researchers affiliated with universities and/or research organizations.
- `other` - Sensors that are deployed by citizen scientists, often low-cost sensors.
